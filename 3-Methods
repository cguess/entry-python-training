# Introduction to Python

## Part 3: Functions

### Functions

What we've done so far is fine and good, and actually how the first programming languages were built, but what if 
we want to use the same code in different places? We could copy and paste, but that seems absurd. So instead we let the
computer, more or less, do it for us!

#### How this looks

Every function has four parts (all languages, more or less, do as well, but Pythons are unique). These parts are the "keyword"
the "name", the "parameters" and the "body". The first three are on one line, followed by a `:` and a new line. The body starts
then on the next line, indented by 4 spaces.

Here's a very simple example

```
def test_function():
    print("Hello World!")
```

Here the `def` says that we're creating a function. Following that `test_function` is the name of the function. Due to
convention we put underscores (`_`) inbetween words in the function name. Following that is the parameters list. This is
surrounded by parentesis. Here, for simplicity's sake, we have no parameters, so it's empty. We call this entire line the
"signature" or "definition" of the function. The signature ends with a single colon (`:`) and a new line

Following that we have the function body, this is indented four spaces. Following that the fuctions ends when there's a blank
space followed by another line.

For example:
```
def test_function():
    print("Hello World!")

test_funtion()
```

`> Hello World!`

This previous example also shows another important action, how to "call" a function. Calling a function means "run this
piece of code and either do something or give me back the results." In this case it will print out `Hello World!`.

But let's say you want to pass a piece of information to the function. So let's modify our previous example and have it print
out whatever we pass in.

```
def test_function(foo):
    print(foo)

test_function("bar")
```
> `bar`

Here `foo` is a variable within the `test_function` function, and you can do whatever you want with it.

Parameteres have a name, and you can pass in multiple parameters to a function. However, the trick is the function has to
expect the parameters and this is called "defining" them. So in the previous example the `test_function` defines `foo`, so the
first thing passed to `test_function` will be assigned to `foo`

We can then call the same function over and over with different values.

```
def test_function(foo):
    print(foo)

test_function("bar")
test_function("bang")
```
> `bar`
> `bang`

This is obviously overly complicated for this example, however let's look at something more "realworld." What if we are writing
something that deal with a lot of currency, like a cash register. This means we need a lot of numbers we print out to have a
"$" sign before it. Now we could do something like `print "$" + amount` over and over, but then we also would have to concern
ourselves with rounding any division, making sure the decimal is the right place, etc. etc. Also, what if we wanted to change
currency? Then we'd have to go in and change every single line. This becomes a lot more complicated.

Here we won't go into how to do all of this, but we'll show an example of how it could be used. One thing to remember is that,
after a function ends (or "returns" as it's properly called) all the variables it has set goes away.

```
def format_as_currency(amount):
    print("$" + amount)

format_as_currency("233")
format_as_currency("42")
```
> `$233`
> `$42`

So in a function you can define your own variables that are specific for that function. For example

```
def format_as_currency(amount):
    currency_symbol = "$"
    print(currency_symbol + amount)

format_as_currency("233")
format_as_currency("42")
```
> `$233`
> `$42`

Which does the same, but now we could also change it easier:
```
def format_as_currency(amount):
    currency_symbol = "€"
    print(currency_symbol + amount)

format_as_currency("233")
format_as_currency("42")
```
> `€233`
> `€42`

Let's say we wanted to be able to split the number between certain amount of checks. Like you do at a restaurant with your
friends. This gets a bit ahead of ourselves, so don't worry about the specific actions, so much as why this is useful.

```
def format_as_currency(amount, number_of_ways_to_split):
    currency_symbol = "€"
    split_amount = amount / number_of_ways_to_split
    print(currency_symbol + split_amount)

format_as_currency("42", 7)
format_as_currency("233", 4)
```
> `€7`
> `€33.2857142857`

This doesn't work because you can't have `.2857142857` Euros. So we need to round the number as well to two decimals.
Luckily, Python supports this pretty easily, but doing it every time would get cumbersom. There's a `round` function, that
takes two parameters, the first is the number, the second is the number of decimal places to round to.

```
def format_as_currency(amount, number_of_ways_to_split):
    currency_symbol = "€"
    split_amount = amount / number_of_ways_to_split
    rounded_split_amount = round(split_amount, 2)
    print(currency_symbol + rounded_split_amount)

format_as_currency("42", 7)
format_as_currency("233", 4)
```
> `€7`
> `€33.27`

Functions can call other functions as well, like above with `round` and `print`.

Some Homework:

Create a function that takes a nominator and denominator, and prints it out as a percentage.
If I call `format_as_percentage(2, 4)`, it should output `50%`. If I call `format_as_percentage(1, 3)` it should be
`33.333%`.
