# Welcome to hello_world.py your first look at Python code!
#
# Traditionally, the first program someone writes in a new language print "Hello World!"
# to the command line and then exits. This gives the coder a brief overview of the most
# simple, and yet most important, aspects of a language.
#
# I've written a very basic hello world program below and also noted the important parts
# of Python
#
# To run this, go to the Terminal, navigate to the folder where this code is and type
# "$ python3 hello_world.py" (without the quotes). You should see a single line printed.


# Comments:
# Comments all start with a '#' character, anything after this character is ignored
# by the computer. Writing a lot of comments is considered good practice since you
# may not be the next person that has to edit whatever you wrote
#
# The program:
# This program consists of a single line of code that does one thing; it calls a single
# method that prints a a string.
#
# Definitions:
#
# Method: A command you can tell the computer to execute, sometimes you write your own,
# sometimes they are provided by the programming language itself. Below you see the "print"
# method, followed by parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis you pass the information you want
# to give to the method.
#
# Argument: A piece of information that can be passed into, and is expected by, the method.
# For instance, the "print" method below needs something to print, so it expect you to give
# it a string to do so with.
#
# String: is a series of characters, letters, numbers, @#$#% etc. that represent text.
# Strings are encased in quotation marks, as you see below

print("Goodbye World!")
